The composition root. This is the only part of the application that knows every module exists,
and it is where the pieces are assembled into a running app: the router skeleton,
authentication, and the wrappers that keep the active organization and project in
sync with the URL.

## One list, three derivations

`di/registry.ts` holds the single array of module declarations:

```typescript
export const modules = [LoginModule, DashboardModule, ProjectModule, …];
export const dependencies = Object.fromEntries(modules.map(m => [m.id, m.domain]));
```

From that one array come **all three** of the app's cross-cutting structures:

- the **router**, via `createAppRouter` (which compiles the routes of every module)
- the **sidebar**, via `navEntriesFor(modules)`
- the **DI container**, via the `dependencies` map

There is no second list to keep in sync. Registering a feature is one line here plus its own
`<feature>.module.ts` — and registration order sets the order things appear in, so the array
reads roughly top-to-bottom as the app does.

One detail is worth its own sentence: the registry imports each `<feature>.module.ts` **by
path**, never the feature's `index.ts`. Barrels re-export UI, and importing one eagerly here
would drag every page into the initial chunk and undo the lazy routes. It is the only deep
import into a feature allowed anywhere in the codebase, and dependency-cruiser enforces that no
one else does it.

## The router owns the skeleton, not the pages

`presentation/ui/router/core.router.ts` describes the shape of the application and nothing about
its content. It declares the **mounts** — the places where module routes graft — and what each
one brings:

```
public         /                                  ← /login, outside the shell
app            /  AppShell = AuthGuard + Layout   ← token or redirect; sidebar, top bar, breadcrumbs
organization   /:organizationSlug                 → sync the org into context
project        /:organizationSlug/projects/:id    → clean stale context, "Project" crumb
```

The shell owns two pages of its own: `/` sends you to your organization, and
`/:organizationSlug` redirects to its dashboard. Everything else is a module's page. Adding a
page means editing one module's declaration; this file does not move. It changes only when a new
mount is introduced or the shell's own structure does.

The router itself is in [platform/routing](../platform/routing/README.md), with no router
library. The route guard is in that module too: each page gets the `permission` it declares.

## Context follows the URL

Three small wrappers keep the [context store](../platform/context/README.md) honest:

- **`OrganizationRedirectWrapper`** — landing on `/` sends you to your organization (the one you
  last used, or your first).
- **`OrganizationSyncWrapper`** — resolves the `:organizationSlug` in the URL to a real
  organization and writes it into the store, falling back if the slug does not match anything
  you can see.
- **`ContextCleanerWrapper`** — clears project and pipeline context when it goes stale, and
  redirects out if the `:projectId` in the URL is not a project you have.

They all sync in one direction: **URL → store**. The URL is the source of truth and the store is
its mirror. That is what makes a pasted link work, and it is why there is no wrapper syncing the
other way — two-way sync would need effects on both sides watching each other.

Each wrapper keeps its logic in a `*.svelte.ts` file beside it, and the tests (in `__test__/`) run that file
without a component.

## Errors are handled once, at the root

`@platform/query` configures the `QueryClient` with a `QueryCache` and a `MutationCache` error
handler.
Together they cover every query and every mutation in the app:

- an `UNAUTHENTICATED` response, or a network failure, clears the token and sends the user to
  `/login`;
- anything else is logged and surfaced as a toast built from the error's user-facing message.

**The practical consequence for feature code: do not add your own `onError` toast to a
mutation.** The root handler already shows one, and a second is a duplicate on screen. If a
mutation needs bespoke handling, it needs bespoke _behaviour_ — not another toast.

Two acknowledged `//todo`s sit alongside that setup: console noise should probably be narrowed
in production, and domain errors would ideally be toasted by the module that owns them. Both are
deliberate beta-stage trade-offs — verbose global reporting makes user-reported problems easier
to trace.

## No provider stack

There are no providers. The query client, the DI registry, the i18n instance and the stores are
module singletons, so any component reads them with an import. `main.ts` loads the locale,
starts the router and mounts `App.svelte`, which renders the theme toggle, the router view and
the toaster.
