/**
 * The V1 permission catalog: the subset of the wire vocabulary a human may
 * toggle when building a role.
 *
 * It holds to one invariant, and the whole design depends on it:
 *
 *   **every permission the UI gates on is in this catalog.**
 *
 * Break it and you get pages no role built here can ever open — the failure
 * mode this catalog was rewritten to kill.
 *
 * The converse almost holds. Three entries are never checked client-side, and
 * all three are load-bearing on the server:
 *  - `READ_PROJECT` / `READ_PIPELINE` guard `GetProject` / `GetPipeline`, and
 *    `READ_PROJECT` is also what narrows the project list to the projects a
 *    caller holds a grant on;
 *  - `LIST_PROJECTS_BY_ORGANIZATION` widens that same list to every project of
 *    the organization. Reading the organization is what opens the page; this
 *    only decides how much of it you see.
 *
 * Everything outside the catalog (invitations, app/agent-side job writes, the
 * per-entity read permissions the backend checks on its own) still travels on
 * the wire and is preserved untouched when a role is edited — it is simply not
 * something this build asks a human to reason about.

 * What each scope confers without asking. Both entries exist because at

 * administrator build a role that is dead on arrival.
 *
 * `READ_ORGANIZATION` is unconditional. There is no membership table on the
 * backend: belonging to an organization *is* holding a grant at its scope, and
 * `readOrganization` is the entire content of the `organization-member` builtin
 * that admits people (`policies.cedar`: the old `org-member` policy is gone,
 * "what belonging used to confer is the `organization-member` builtin role").
 * Untickable, it would let someone be admitted to an organization they cannot
 * see.
 *
 * `READ_PROJECT` rides on `LIST_PROJECTS_BY_ORGANIZATION`, because the backend
 * splits the two across RPCs that only make sense together at this scope
 * (`project/use_case.rs`): `list_by_organization` widens the list to every
 * project once `listProjectsByOrganization` holds, so `readProject` adds nothing
 * to *visibility* — but `get` checks `readProject` unconditionally, so without it
 * the holder lists every project and opens none. An organization-scoped grant
 * conferring `readProject` covers every project of the organization (Cedar
 * `resource in ?resource`), which is what makes the pairing exact rather than
 * approximate.
 *
 * Neither applies at SYSTEM scope, where both are genuinely separable: there
 * they mean "every organization / every project on the instance", capabilities
 * an administrator should have to ask for. PROJECT scope is untouched — a
 * project role is about one project, and `READ_PROJECT` is its whole point.
 *
 * `MANAGE_SYSTEM_GRANTS` follows the same rule at SYSTEM scope, riding on
 * `MANAGE_ROLES`: whoever writes the role catalog is who hands roles out, so
 * the two are one capability. Offered separately, a "manage roles" role could
 * author roles nobody is able to receive — and the narrower
 * `MANAGE_ORG_GRANTS` / `MANAGE_PROJECT_GRANTS` are what delegating a *part* of
 * grant administration looks like, so the system-wide one is not a dial.
