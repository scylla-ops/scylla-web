# `features/jobs` — agent guide

Pipeline runs: their status, their logs, and the live tail of both.

**Layer** `features/` · **id** `jobs` · **DI key** `jobsRepository`

## Import rules

- May import: `@platform/*` barrels, `@shared/*`, other features' `index.ts`.
- Must never import: `core/`, `layout/`, another feature's internals.
- Outside code reaches this module **only** through `index.ts`.

## Public API — `index.ts`

```typescript
type JobEntity
type JobLog, JobLogStream
type JobsSummary, JobStatus
summarizeJobs, isActiveStatus, isFinishedStatus
JOBS_QUERY_KEY, ORGANIZATION_JOBS_QUERY_KEY, JOBS_QUERY_ROOT
useOrganizationJobs, useJobsByPipelines
JobsPage                              ← the documented page exception
```

`JobsPage` is exported because `pipeline` composes it behind its own route (it owns the Run
action). That consumer is itself lazily loaded, which is what makes the exception safe. Do not
add a second page export — `JobDetailsPage` is mounted by this module's own route instead, which
is why it stays private.

Never add: `jobs.module.ts`, `use-jobs-domain.ts`.

## Data contract

`JobsRepository` — `domain/repository/jobs.repository.ts`:

| Method | Returns |
|---|---|
| `getByPipelineId(...)` | paginated `JobEntity` list |
| `getByOrganizationId(...)` | paginated `JobEntity` list |
| `getById(jobId)` | `JobEntity` |
| `deleteById(jobId)` | `void` |
| `getLogs(...)` | `JobLog[]` |
| `tailLogs(jobId, nodeId?)` | **`ScyllaResult<JobLogStream>` — synchronous, not a Promise** |

`tailLogs` is the one non-`Promise` method in the codebase: it opens a server stream and returns
the handle immediately. Consume it in an effect (a genuine outside-React subscription) and
**always close it in the cleanup**.

Reach the repository with `useJobsDomain()` **inside a hook only**.

## Layout

```
jobs.module.ts                       DI wiring + the job details route (no nav)
index.ts                             public API
domain/
  entities/job.entity.ts             JobEntity
  structs/job.struct.ts              JobLog, JobLogStream
  structs/jobs-summary.struct.ts     JobsSummary, JobStatus + summarizeJobs,
                                     isActiveStatus, isFinishedStatus (pure)
  repository/jobs.repository.ts
infrastructure/
  repository/data-sources/jobs-remote.data-source.ts    interface

  repository/mappers/grpc-job.mapper.ts
  repository/default-jobs.repository.ts
presentation/
  hooks/jobs.query-keys.ts           key factories — import these, never inline a key
  hooks/use-jobs-domain.ts           DI accessor (private)
  hooks/use-job.ts, use-organization-jobs.ts, use-pipelines-jobs.ts,
  hooks/use-jobs-by-pipelines.ts     useQueries fan-out, avoids N+1
  hooks/use-job-logs.ts, use-tail-job-logs.ts, use-delete-jobs.ts
  hooks/use-streamed-log-view.ts     owns the log viewer's document + tail-follow
  ui/Jobs.page.tsx, JobsHeader.tsx
  ui/JobDetails.page.tsx             one job: info + per-node logs
  ui/job-details/                    JobSummary, JobNodeLogs
  ui/jobs-table/                     JobsTable + columns + cells (index.ts is local, not public)
  ui/jobs-log/JobLogDisplay.tsx      the streamed viewer, shared by both pages
```

## Routes & nav

| Mount | Path | Permission | Component |
|---|---|---|---|
| `project` | `pipelines/:pipelineId/jobs/:jobId` | `READ_JOB` | `JobDetailsPage` |

No nav entry. The jobs **list** is not declared here: it is mounted by
[`pipeline`](../pipeline/AGENTS.md) at `project` → `pipelines/:pipelineId/jobs`, gated on
`LIST_JOBS_BY_PIPELINE`, via `PipelineJobsRoute`, because that page needs a Run action. If you
change `JobsPage`'s props, that is the call site to update.

One job needs nothing from `pipeline`, so its route lives here — a flat sibling of the list route
rather than a child of it, since two modules cannot share one path segment when the parent
already renders a page of its own.

## Rules that bite here

- **Query keys come from `jobs.query-keys.ts`.** Four exist; three (`JOBS_QUERY_KEY`,
  `ORGANIZATION_JOBS_QUERY_KEY`, `JOBS_QUERY_ROOT`) are exported publicly so other modules
  invalidate the *same* key this module queries, and `JOB_QUERY_KEY` (one job, read by the
  details page) stays internal. Never hand-write `['jobs', ...]`.
- `JOBS_QUERY_ROOT` is the prefix for "invalidate everything jobs-related" after a run;
  `JOBS_QUERY_KEY(pipelineId)` is exact. Pick deliberately.
- **`summarizeJobs`, `isActiveStatus`, `isFinishedStatus` are pure domain functions.** Status
  logic goes there, not into a component or a `useMemo`.
- Log tailing is a subscription: `useEffect` is *correct* here. It is one of the few places in
  the codebase where it is. Same for `use-streamed-log-view.ts`, which drives an editor instance.
- **Never pass the live log string as `<ReactCodeMirror value>`.** The library re-syncs a changed
  `value` with `changes: { from: 0, to: doc.length }` — a whole-document replacement — which
  resets the scroll offset and collapses the selection. At one flush per 150 ms the log appears
  to jump back to the top and nothing can be selected. `useStreamedLogView` appends the delta
  instead; give it the log string, pass its `initialValue` as `value` (it never changes) and its
  `onCreateEditor` to the editor.
- **Never scroll that viewer to the bottom on every `logs` change** either — same flush rate,
  and it steals the viewport from a user who scrolled up or is dragging a selection. The same
  hook owns that decision.
- **The log viewer is sized by its caller, never by itself.** `JobLogDisplay` takes a `maxHeight`
  in pixels and grows with the log up to it; the details page gives the whole job's panel the
  column it measured with `useMeasuredHeight()`, and every node panel one fixed readable height
  whatever the count — the column scrolls rather than shrink them. A fixed height on the editor
  itself is what this replaced — do not put one back.
- Lists go through `DataTable` + `usePagination()`. Row keys are job ids, never indices.
- **The details page is the one place a job's logs are read.** Everywhere a job is displayed —
  the jobs table's view action and timeline, the pipeline dashboard's history and last run —
  links there through `useScyllaNavigate().goToJobDetails(...)`. Which log panels are open is the
  `nodes` search param, not component state, so those links can open straight onto one node's
  logs.
- **The whole job and the nodes are exclusive.** The details page opens a `JobLogDisplay` per node
  the URL names, and the job as a whole only when it names none — the whole job is the page at
  rest, never a panel standing alongside the nodes, which is why its panel has no close button.
  Closing the last node panel is what comes back to it.
- **The timeline picks one node, the log nav builds a set.** A click on a timeline segment shows
  that node alone (`selectNode`) — the same jump the links from the jobs list and the pipeline
  dashboard make, landing on the page rather than moving inside it. The nav under the summary
  adds and removes panels instead (`toggleNode`), which is what lets two nodes' output be read
  side by side.
- **Log panels are independent, and each one is a live stream.** Every open panel holds its own
  `useTailJobLogs` subscription. Closing a panel unmounts it, which is what cancels that stream —
  never hide one with CSS instead.

## Before done

`pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm depcruise && pnpm depcruise:cycles && pnpm i18n:collisions`
— all clean.
New strings: `pnpm extract && pnpm compile`.
