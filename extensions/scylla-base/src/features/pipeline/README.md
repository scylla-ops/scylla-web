# Pipeline

A pipeline is the definition of what Scylla runs: an ordered graph of steps belonging to a
project. This is the largest module in the frontend, and it covers both halves of the
lifecycle — authoring a pipeline and watching it run.

## What it covers

- **The project's pipeline dashboard** (the project index route) — every pipeline in the
  project, with its last run, its status and a chart. Each run in that chart, and the last-run
  cell, opens that job's details page in [jobs](../jobs/README.md); "View jobs" still opens the
  full, unclipped list.
- **The editor** — creating and updating a pipeline, in two coordinated views.
- **Running** — the Run action, and the jobs page that follows it.
- **Organization-wide reads** — pipeline metadata across every project, for the
  [dashboard](../dashboard/README.md).

## Metadata vs entity

The most important modelling decision here is that a pipeline has two shapes:

- **`PipelineMetadata`** — id, name, project, status. What a *list* needs.
- **`PipelineEntity`** — the whole thing, including its `PipelineStep[]`. What the *editor*
  needs.

The repository exposes them through different methods, and lists never fetch the full entity.
On a project with fifty pipelines that is the difference between fifty step graphs crossing the
wire and none. If you are adding a column to a list, add it to the metadata; reach for
`getById` only when you genuinely need the steps.

## The editor: two views of one definition

`PipelineEditor` presents a pipeline as both a **visual graph** and a **script**, and the two
stay in sync.

The graph is [@xyflow/svelte](https://xyflow.dev): `BlueprintCanvas` with custom nodes
(`StartNode`, `PipelineStepNode`), custom edges (`DeletableEdge`), and dialogs for editing a
node's configuration. `blueprint.state.svelte.ts` is the ViewModel (Svelte Runes-based) that owns
the nodes and edges, keeping them in sync with the document. `blueprint-converter.ts` is the
single place that translates between the graph and the domain's `PipelineStep[]` — both directions,
so the round-trip can't drift. It's written in pure TypeScript and thoroughly tested.

The script side is CodeMirror 6, accessed via a Svelte `action` (see `code-mirror.actions.ts` in
`shared/`). `pipeline-script.state.svelte.ts` holds `script` and `initialScript`: the draft text
and the baseline for the dirty check. That is UI state hosted in a ViewModel, and it stays there
— the *saved* pipeline stays in TanStack Query.

CodeMirror is the clearest legitimate use of Svelte `$effect` in this module: it's a system
outside the framework that has to be synchronized imperatively. That licence stops at the
editor's edge: the rest of the module derives during render with Runes.

## Owning the jobs route

`/:org/projects/:projectId/pipelines/:pipelineId/jobs` is declared by **this** module, not by
[jobs](../jobs/README.md), even though it shows a jobs table.

The reason is the Run button. Running is a pipeline operation. If `jobs` owned the route it
would need a pipeline mutation, which means importing `pipeline` for a concern that isn't its
own. Instead `PipelineJobsRoute` wraps `JobsPage` — imported from `jobs`'s public API — and
supplies the Run action itself. `JobsPage` is one of only two pages in the codebase exported
from a feature barrel, and this is its single consumer.

## Cache coordination

`PIPELINES_QUERY_KEY`, `ORGANIZATION_PIPELINES_QUERY_KEY` and `PIPELINES_QUERY_ROOT` are part of
the public API so other modules invalidate exactly what this one reads.

Running a pipeline is the interesting case: it creates a *job*, so `useRunPipeline` invalidates
the jobs keys as well as its own. That cross-module invalidation only works because both modules
export their key factories instead of writing arrays inline.

## Routes

| Path | Permission | What |
|---|---|---|
| project index | `LIST_PIPELINES_BY_PROJECT` | the pipeline dashboard |
| `create` | `CREATE_PIPELINE` | new pipeline |
| `edit/:pipelineId` | `UPDATE_PIPELINE` | editor |
| `pipelines/:pipelineId/jobs` | `LIST_JOBS_BY_PIPELINE` | runs, with Run |

No sidebar entry: pipelines *are* the project, reached by entering one.
